abstract = {This study aims to determine an optimum estimate for the gravitational vector and vertical acceleration profiles using a body-worn tri-axial accelerometer during falls and normal activities of daily living (ADL), validated using a camera based motion analysis system. Five young healthy subjects performed a number of simulated falls and normal ADL while trunk kinematics were measured by both an optical motion analysis system and a tri-axial accelerometer. Through low-pass filtering of the trunk tri-axial accelerometer signal between 1Hz and 2.7Hz using a 1{\textless}sup{\textgreater}st{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} order or higher, Butterworth IIR filter, accurate gravity vector profile can be obtained using the method described here. Results: a high mean correlation ({\&}{\#}x2265;0.83: Coefficient of Multiple Correlations) and low mean percentage error ({\&}{\#}x2264;2.06m/s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) were found between the vertical acceleration profile generated from the tri-axial accelerometer based sensor to those from the optical motion capture system. This proposed system enables optimum gravity vector and vertical acceleration profiles to be measured from the trunk during falls and normal ADL.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a wireless Micro-Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) which is used for localization of people in indoor areas. The Micro-IMU is built especially for portable applications. The main target of the IMU design was to minimize the size, weight and power consumption, as much as possible whereas the performance is still comparable to commercially available wired IMUs. Through the minimum size the IMU can be integrated into clothes or shoes and provide the full functionality of pedometers. In an experiment the Micro-IMU was mounted on a shoe for detecting the human movement. With sensor data-fusion based on Kalman Filter and ZUPT (Zero Velocity Update) Algorithm we could track a person in an indoor area.},

abstract = {Fall detection is a major challenge in the public health care domain, especially for the elderly, and reliable surveillance is a necessity to mitigate the effects of falls. The technology and products related to fall detection have always been in high demand within the security and the health-care industries. An effective fall detection system is required to provide urgent support and to significantly reduce the medical care costs associated with falls. In this paper, we give a comprehensive survey of different systems for fall detection and their underlying algorithms. Fall detection approaches are divided into three main categories: wearable device based, ambience device based and vision based. These approaches are summarised and compared with each other and a conclusion is derived with some discussions on possible future work. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Accidental falls are frequent and dangerous events for the elderly population, which can result into serious injury or fracture of bones especially hip bone injury or other joint fractures. There are several methods for detecting falls of elderly, such as camera-based, personal emergency response System (PERS), and wearable sensor-based. However, the camera-based method is limited by instrumented spaces and the PERS is suffer from inability to give an alarm after a fall. The wearable sensor-based fall detection is not limited to instrumented spaces, moreover, it is easily to detect the falls through tracking the kinematic information about the monitored person. In this paper, a wearable Micro-electromechanical Systems (MEMS)-based sensors module is designed for fall detection including one three-axis accelerometer, one three-axis gyroscope and one three-axis magnetometer. However, falls from activities of daily living (ADL) make it difficult to distinguish real falls from certain fall-like activities such as sitting down quickly and jumping. An approach is proposed using attitude angles to reduce false falls through tests of static postures and dynamic transitions. Meanwhile, the proposed method has real-time response and high computation efficiency.},

@article{Zhang2017,
abstract = {Due to the drift of low-cost micro-electromechanical systems sensors and recursive computation, pedestrian tracking based on foot-mounted inertial sensors suffers from accumulative velocity and position errors. The well-known approach named zero velocity update (ZUPT) is able to minimize such errors by resetting the velocity to zero when the foot does not move with respect to ground. This time duration is called the still phase of a stride and can be detected by comparing the actual sensor data with a pre-defined threshold. However, when the velocity increases or decreases, the fixed threshold may be too small or too big for the correct detection of the still phase. Based on our previous study, this paper presents a novel adaptive ZUPT approach using an additional chest-attached accelerometer for consistent removal of accumulative errors even if the velocity changes. The information extracted from the chest acceleration is used to update corresponding threshold for the still-phase detection, and, hence, to determine error-free velocity and position information. The experimental results show that the accurate tracking trajectory can still be successfully obtained even if the velocity changes rapidly during the experiment.},
